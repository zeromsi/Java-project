There are millions of small/medium shops and restaurants around the country who follows manual sales system. 
This old system requires lots of paper works and time as a result of bulk and slow data processing. It’s 
very hard to track the business success, calculate budget, make decisions, get current stock updates, identify 
which items are selling, which are not and others in primitive system. Again, there is question about 
miscalculation which can be destructive for a small business. This system (POS) is going to solve all these 
problems. It’s a small but very effective system that will handle complex calculations, help the owner to 
make strategic decisions and others.
